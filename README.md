Interstitial Ads

Interstitial Ads are short static or video ads, usually shown between levels or when game is over.

    ?placement:String = Enhance.PLACEMENT_DEFAULT
):Bool
```

Check if an interstitial ad from any of the included SDK providers is ready to be shown.
Placement is optional and specifies an internal placement (from the Enhance mediation editor). 
Returns true if any ad is ready, false otherwise.


```
Enhance.showInterstitialAd(
    ?placement:String = Enhance.PLACEMENT_DEFAULT
):Void
```

Display a new interstitial ad if any is currently available. The ad provider is selected based on your app's mediation settings.

Rewarded Ads
------------

Rewarded Ads are usually full-screen video ads which users can view to receive a reward inside the application, like an additional in-game currency or a health bonus.


Example Usage:


```haxe
// Callbacks:

var onRewardGranted = function(rewardType:String, rewardValue:Int) 
{ 
    if(rewardType == Enhance.REWARD_ITEM)
        _logOutput.writeLog("Reward granted (item)");

    else if(rewardType == Enhance.REWARD_COINS)
        _logOutput.writeLog("Reward granted (coins), value: " + rewardValue);
};

var onRewardDeclined = function() {
    _logOutput.writeLog("Reward declined");
};

var onRewardUnavailable = function() {
    _logOutput.writeLog("Reward unavailable");
};

if(Enhance.isRewardedAdReady()) {
    Enhance.showRewardedAd(onRewardGranted, onRewardDeclined, onRewardUnavailable);
}
```

Methods:

```haxe
Enhance.isRewardedAdReady(
    ?placement:String = Enhance.REWARDED_PLACEMENT_NEUTRAL

Banner Ads are small sized ads displayed on the screen as a rectangle filled with content without interrupting the flow of the app.


Example Usage:

```haxe
// Toggle the banner ad

if (isBannerVisible) {
    Enhance.hideBannerAd();
    isBannerVisible = false;
}

else if (Enhance.isBannerAdReady()) {

```haxe

```

The bottom of the screen, use to set banner ads position.


Offer Walls
-----------

Offer Walls show full screen of real world offers (e.g. surveys), usually with a reward offered in return for a completion.


Example usage:

```haxe
var onCurrencyReceived = function(amount:Int) {
    writeLog ("Currency received: " + amount);
};

Enhance.setReceivedCurrencyCallback(onCurrencyReceived);

if(Enhance.isOfferwallReady()) {
    Enhance.showOfferwall();
}
```


Methods:

```haxe
Enhance.setReceivedCurrencyCallback(
    onCurrencyReceivedCallback:Int->Void
):Void
```

Specify the function which is called every time the user receives a reward from any offerwall. We recommend that you use this function at the beginning of your appâ€™s logic to be sure the callback is ready as soon as an offerwall sends the reward. This could happen at different times, even right after your app starts! As a parameter, this action will receive an amount of the granted currency (int).
Returns nothing.


```haxe
Enhance.isOfferwallReady(
    ?placement:String = Enhance.PLACEMENT_DEFAULT
):Bool
```

Check if an offerwall from any of the included SDK providers is ready to be shown.
Placement is an optional internal placement (from the Enhance mediation editor).
Returns true if any offerwall is ready, false otherwise.

Returns nothing.


Members:

```haxe
Enhance.PLACEMENT_DEFAULT:String
```

The default placement of ads, including offer walls.


Special Offers
--------------

Special offers are real world offers (e.g. surveys). They are available through Enhance ZeroCode, but you can also request them manually from code.


Example Usage:

```haxe
if (Enhance.isSpecialOfferReady()) {
    // The offer is ready, show it
    Enhance.showSpecialOffer();
}
```


Methods:

```haxe
Enhance.isSpecialOfferReady(
    ?placement:String = Enhance.PLACEMENT_DEFAULT
):Bool
```

Analytics
---------

The connector library allows you to send custom events to the hooked analytics networks.


Example Usage:

```haxe
Enhance.logEvent("game_over", "level", "1");
Enhance.logEvent("user_exit");
```


Methods:

```haxe
Enhance.logEvent(
    eventType:String,
    ?paramKey:String,
    ?paramValue:String
):Void
```

Send an event with an additional parameter (optional).


Local Notifications
-------------------

Local Notifications are reminders which show up on your screen after the app becomes inactive for a specific amount of time.


Example Usage:

```haxe
var onPermissionGranted = function() {
    // Success
    Enhance.enableLocalNotification("Game", "Play me!", 60);
};

var onPermissionRefused = function() {
    // Failure
};

Enhance.requestLocalNotificationPermission(onPermissionGranted, onPermissionRefused);
```


Methods:

```haxe
Enhance.requestLocalNotificationPermission(
    onPermissionGrantedCallback:Void->Void,
    onPermissionRefusedCallback:Void->Void
):Void
```

Request a permission from the user to show local notifications. This won't have any effect on Android devices as you don't need a permission to schedule local notifications there (onPermissionGrantedCallback will be still fired).
Returns nothing.


```haxe
Enhance.enableLocalNotification(
    title:String,
    message:String,
    delaySeconds:Int
):Void
```

Schedule a new local notification, if possible. The notification will persist until you disable it manually. For example, if you set a notification for 60 seconds, it will invoke this notification 60 seconds after the app is closed every time.
Returns nothing.


```haxe
Enhance.disableLocalNotification():Void
```

Disable any local notification that was previously enabled.


In-App Purchases
-------------------

The connector library provides a set of functions which help you to make use of different In-App Purchases SDKs in your application.


Example Usage:

```haxe
var onPurchaseSuccess = function() {
    var price:String = Enhance.purchases.getDisplayPrice("my_product", "$5");

    var title:String = Enhance.purchases.getDisplayTitle("my_product", "My Product");

    var desc:String  = Enhance.purchases.getDisplayDescription("my_product", "Some useful item.");
};

var onPurchaseFailed = function() {
    // Failure
};

if (Enhance.purchases.isSupported()) {
    Enhance.purchases.attemptPurchase("my_product", onPurchaseSuccess, onPurchaseFailed);
}
```


Methods:

```haxe
Enhance.purchases.isSupported():Bool
